# ISAP-4 Computer
The ISAP-4 computer is the modified version of the SAP-3 computer I made that has the registers implemented in RAM.

## About the project, brief description
The goal of this project is to create a more efficient version of the SAP-3 (Simple As Possible) computer, which uses much less hardware by implementing registers in RAM.

## ISAP-4 version 1.0
The initial version that I want to do is a redesign of the ISAP-3 computer. To do this, we need to retrace the steps that we took when designing the ISAP-3 computer.

Version 1.0 will be an implementation of the ISAP-3 computer that is as close to the original as possible. This will be the reference, the starting point for creating a better version.
